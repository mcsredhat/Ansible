### Explanation of Each Component in the Policy Document part1
- **`"Version": "2012-10-17"`**: This is the date of the policy language version used. Amazon recommends using the 2012-10-17 version, as it includes support for advanced policy features.
  
- **`"Statement"`**: The `Statement` element is an array of individual permissions statements. Each statement block defines a specific set of permissions.
  
- **`"Effect": "Allow"`**: This defines the effect of the policy, which in this case is `"Allow"`. This means that the actions specified in this statement are permitted.

- **`"Action"`**: The `Action` block lists the specific actions that are permitted by this policy. In this case:
  - **`"s3:ListBucket"`** allows listing the contents of S3 buckets.
  - **`"s3:GetObject"`** allows getting or downloading individual objects from any S3 bucket.
  
- **`"Resource": "*"`**: The `Resource` element specifies which AWS resources these actions apply to. The asterisk (`*`) represents "all resources," so this policy permits these actions across all S3 buckets and objects in the account.

```yaml
custom_policy_document: |               # JSON document defining a custom IAM policy for limited S3 access.
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",            # Specifies the version of the policy language; 2012-10-17 is the latest standard version.
    "Statement": [                      # Statement block where policy permissions are defined.
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",              # Effect of the policy; "Allow" permits the actions specified in the policy.
        "Action": [                     # Actions that are permitted by this policy. This array can contain multiple actions.
          "s3:ListBucket",              # Allows listing all objects in an S3 bucket (used for viewing bucket contents).
          "s3:GetObject"                # Allows downloading (getting) objects from S3 buckets.
        ],
        "Resource": "*"                 # Specifies the resources the actions apply to. "*" means all resources, so this applies to all S3 buckets and objects.
      }
    ]
  }
```

This custom policy allows users to:
- View the contents of any S3 bucket in the account (`s3:ListBucket`).
- Download objects from any S3 bucket (`s3:GetObject`).
